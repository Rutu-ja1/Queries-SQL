## 🔍 SQL Query Practice – Basic SELECT Statements

This module focuses on practicing fundamental SQL query operations using a dataset from a **Virtual Medical Assistant Project**. The SQL scripts included in this section are designed to help beginners and intermediates strengthen their understanding of data retrieval using `SELECT` statements.
